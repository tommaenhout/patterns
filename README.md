# React Design Patterns Examples

This project serves as a practical demonstration of various React design patterns that help in writing cleaner, more maintainable code. Each pattern is implemented with real-world examples to showcase best practices in React development.

## Design Patterns Included

### 1. Higher-Order Components (HOC)
- Pattern that allows component reuse through wrapping
- Adds additional functionality to existing components
- Examples of common use cases like authentication, logging, and data fetching

### 2. Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
- Demonstration of form handling patterns

### 3. React Hooks
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### 4. Container Components
- Separation of concerns between data and presentation
- Container components handling business logic
- Presentational components focusing on UI
- Examples of proper component composition

### 5. Component Composition
- Building complex UIs from simple components
- Proper props passing
- Children prop usage
- Compound components pattern

### 6. State Management Patterns
- Local state management
- Prop drilling solutions
- Context API usage
- State lifting patterns
